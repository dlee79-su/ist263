        <article class="musicblog1">
            <p>
                Over winter break, I was reintroduced to “Show Me the Money,” a Korean rap show that I used to keep up with. I hadn’t watched it in quite some time, but a friend of mine played a song from the most recent season on a drive back home and it hit the right spot. The song was “VVS” by JUSTHIS, Miranni, Munchman, MUSHVENOM, and Khundi Panda produced by Groovyroom. As soon as I got back home, I caught up on all the episodes and downloaded all the music that had been released so far. <br><br>
           
                From there my love for Korean music was truly harvested. When people think of Korean music, they instantly think of Kpop and nothing else. But there is so much more than that just like how there is more than just country in American music. Korea’s hip-hop and RnB scene are slowly but surely on the rise with companies like Ambition, Indigo, and H1ghr leading the way. I had always heard of these groups and several artists in the Korean hip-hop industry but only because they had a super popular song at the time that made its way to America. However, after listening to “VVS,” everything changed. <br><br>
            
                I now can no longer listen to American music. If my friends play it in their cars or at their apartments, I just deal with it. But these days I have noticed that I have a strong urge to just grab the remote and play Korean music. Instead, I just keep myself under control then go indulge myself in it when I get back to my room. <br><br>
            
                Here are some songs that I recommend: <br>
                <ul> 
                    <li>"VVS" from SMTM 9</li>
                    <li>"Win Win" from SMTM 9</li>
                    <li>"Peter Pan" from SMTM 9</li>
                    <li>"Good Day" from SMTM 7</li>
                    <li>"Orange" from SMTM 7</li>
                    <li>"Day Day" from SMTM 7</li>
                    <li>"Go High" from HSR 3</li>
                    <li>"Gotta Go" from Blue Tape H1ghr compilation album</li>
                    <li>"Meteor" by Chang Mo</li>
                    <li>"Maestro" by Chang Mo</li>
                    <li>"Simon Dominic" by Simon Dominic</li>
                    <li>"Puzzle" by Bewhy and C Jamm</li>
                </ul><br>
           
                There is one artist I tried to keep out of this because this whole next section is going to be dedicated to him and that is pH-1. pH-1 is now my favorite artist of all time. For one, we have pretty similar backgrounds growing up as Korean Americans. But there is just something about him that draws me in. I cannot get sick of his music no matter how many times I listen to it. He is known for his singing type of rap and his melodies, tone, rhythm and lyrics are all on point. Catchy enough to be stuck in your head but too trendy or overwhelming. I feel like you can “dress up” and “dress down” pH-1’s music. It is suitable and adaptable to every situation. <br><br>
            
                My favorite songs by him (some are repeated from the previous list): <br>
                <ul> 
                    <li>"Orange"</li>
                    <li>"Homebody"</li>
                    <li>"Like You</li>
                    <li>"Hate You"</li>
                    <li>"Okay"</li>
                    <li>"Nikes"</li>
                    <li>"Till I Die"</li>
                    <li>"Malibu"</li>
                </ul><br>
            
                There is a lot of doubt and hesitation when it comes to Korean music, but if you truly enjoy music for what it is, the cultural barriers will have no effect. A lot of people invalidate my opinions because I am Korean, but the truth is I can’t even read or write the language. I can only speak and understand it because I grew up with it, but I never learned it. I ask you to give the songs listed a listen. They will unlock a whole new world and perspective for you. And if you don’t like it, at least you gave it a try and that is what’s important. <br><br>
