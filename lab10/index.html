        <p>
            I am a <strong>Communication and Rhetorical Studies</strong> major with an <br>
            <strong>Information management and Technology</strong> minor. With this <br>
            education, I hope to pursue a career in Public Relations and Marketing. I <br>
            would love to work in any of the following industries: music, entertainment, <br>
             sports, and fashion. 
        </p>

        Accomplishments and Skills:
           <ul>
           <li>Certified Eagle Scout</li>
           <li>Dean's List</li>

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>

        <p>
            I am from Los Angeles, California but actually lived in Chengdu, <br>
            China for half of my life even though I am Korean.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of the classroom, I work as a part-time customer service <br>
            representative and a full-time residential advisor. I enjoy <br>
            being active and often golf and pay backetball when I have the <br>
            time. A more relaxed day for me involves listening to music, <br>
            watching movies, drawing, and hanging with friends.
