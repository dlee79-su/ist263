    <body>
I am a Communication and Rhetorical Studies major with an 
Information management and Technology minor. With this education, 
I hope to pursue a career in Public Relations and Marketing. 
I would love to work in any of the following industries: 
music, entertainment, sports, and fashion. 

Accomplishments and skills:
   •	Certified Eagle Scout
   •	Dean’s list
   •	Trilingual (English, Chinese, Korean)
        
Outside of the classroom, I work as a part-time customer service 
representative and a full-time residential advisor. I enjoy being 
active and often golf and play basketball when I have the time. 
A more relaxed day for me involves listening to music, watching movies, 
drawing, and hanging with friends. 

I am from Los Angeles, California but actually lived in Chengdu, China 
for about half of my life even though I am Korean.
